You are a code reviewer. Analyze each code change in this git commit and label it with the most appropriate Conventional Commit type.

# Core Task
For each provided commit diff, identify all distinct changes. A single commit can contain multiple changes requiring different labels. Classify each change based on the rules below.
First, always check if the change fits into one of these "Purpose" categories.
**Only if a change does not fit any "Purpose" category**, classify it based on what kind of entity was changed.
# Classification Rules & Taxonomy

You must classify changes based on a two-tier priority system: **Purpose-first, then Object.**
## Tier 1: Purpose (The "Why")
First, always check if the change fits into one of these "Purpose" categories. These have the highest priority.

- **feat**: The change introduces a new feature or functionality to the code.
- **fix**: The change patches a bug or corrects an error in the code.
- **refactor**: The change restructures existing code without altering its external behavior (e.g., improving readability, simplifying complexity, removing unused code).

## Tier 2: Object (The "What")
**Only if a change does not fit any "Purpose" category**, classify it based on what kind of entity was changed.
- **docs**: The change exclusively modifies documentation, comments, or other text assets.
- **test**: The change exclusively modifies test files, including the addition or updating of tests
- **cicd**: The change exclusively modifies CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., `.github/workflows`).
- **build**: The change exclusively modifies build scripts, dependencies, or tooling (e.g., `Makefile`, `package.json`).
### **--- CRITICAL RULE: Purpose ALWAYS Overrides Object ---**
- If a change has both a purpose and an object, **the purpose is the ONLY correct label.**
- **Example 1:** Adding new tests (`test`) to an existing feature. The correct label is `test`, because no Tier 1 purpose (feat/fix/refactor) applies, falling back to the Tier 2 object category.
- **Example 2:** Fixing a bug (`fix`) in a build script (`build`). The correct label is `fix`, because the primary intent was to correct an error.
- **Example 3:** Updating a `README.md` file with no code changes. This has no clear `feat`, `fix`, or `refactor` purpose, so it falls back to the object, and the label is `docs`.

Step 1: The intent is to add a new test assertion for the existing English synthesizer functionality with "+INDT" parameter.  
Step 2: The change affects the test file by adding an additional assertEquals statement to verify synthesizer behavior.  
Step 3: The behavioral impact is enhanced test coverage for existing functionality, not introducing new features or fixing bugs.  
Step 4: Since this does not fit any Tier 1 purpose (feat/fix/refactor), it falls back to Tier 2 object classification. The change modifies test files → test.

<reasoning id="example-2">
Step 1: This commit contains two distinct changes: (1) enhancing SELinux enforcing mode handling with comprehensive validation and logging, and (2) removing unused imports from AssemblyRecipe class.  
Step 2: The first change replaces simple boolean logic with String-based mode validation, adds informative logging, and SystemProperties persistence. The second change removes the unused StackHelper import and extra whitespace.  
Step 3: The behavioral impact differs: the SELinux change introduces new functionality (error handling, logging, persistence) while the import cleanup improves code quality without changing behavior.  
Step 4: The SELinux change expands system capabilities → feat. The import cleanup restructures code without altering external behavior → refactor.
