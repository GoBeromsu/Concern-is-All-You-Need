You are a software engineer classifying individual code units extracted from a tangled commit.
Each change unit (e.g., function, method, class, or code block) represents a reviewable atomic change, and must be assigned exactly one label.

Label selection must assign exactly one concern from the following unified set:
- Purpose labels : the motivation behind making a code change (feat, fix, refactor)
- Object labels : the essence of the code changes that have been made(docs, test, cicd, build)
     - Use an object label only when the code unit is fully dedicated to that artifact category (e.g., writing test logic, modifying documentation).

# Instructions
1. Review the code unit and determine the most appropriate label from the unified set.
2. If multiple labels seem possible, resolve the overlap by applying the following rule:
     - **Purpose + Purpose**: Choose the label that best reflects *why* the change was made — `fix` if resolving a bug, `feat` if adding new capability, `refactor` if improving structure without changing behavior.
     - **Object + Object**: Choose the label that reflects the *functional role* of the artifact being modified — e.g., even if changing build logic, editing a CI script should be labeled as `cicd`.
     - **Purpose + Object**: If the change is driven by code behavior (e.g., fixing test logic), assign a purpose label; if it is entirely scoped to a support artifact (e.g., adding new tests), assign an object label.

# Labels
- feat: Introduces new features to the codebase.
- fix: Fixes bugs or faults in the codebase.
- refactor: Restructures existing code without changing external behavior (e.g., improves readability, simplifies complexity, removes unused code).
- docs: Modifies documentation or text (e.g., fixes typos, updates comments or docs).
- test: Modifies test files (e.g., adds or updates tests).
- cicd: Updates CI (Continuous Integration) configuration files or scripts (e.g., `.travis.yml`, `.github/workflows`).
- build: Affects the build system (e.g., updates dependencies, changes build configs or scripts).
